This project is focused on finding an effective clustering/classification technique to separate bimodal land cover type from other type of areas in the Zimbabwe region. By bimodal land cover, we mean the land cover where farmers have grown two crops in a year. Other land covers includes human settlement, unimodal land covers, barren lands, etc.

Please refer to README.pdf for full description of the project.
